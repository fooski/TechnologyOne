The program included is a console program used to convert numbers between 1 - 9999 to words
for example, entering "123.45" will produce "ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY-FIVE CENTS"
This program can be run directly in IDE console. Once ran the program will prompt for user input, enter any number in the format of *.?? (positive Integer.2 digit decimal)
For integer values the decimal numbers can either be omitted or written as 0. For example: eight dollars can be entered as 8.00 or simply as 8.
